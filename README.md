# Project Bee Movies

## Introduction

Bee Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

Analyse the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project.

The SQL script file for the questions is given below.

## Importance for implementing the project
1. It is significant to go through the data thoroughly, giving you a good sense of what all the columns represent which is a good practice to follow before proceeding with the analysis
2. Try using appropriate aliases for the variable names. Avoid using names: ABC, abc, etc.
3. Try to write optimized codes. Use appropriate tables and joins as per the questions asked.

## Dataset and Database Creation
- The ERD diagram to help you understand the relationship between those tables. 
- Study the ERD closely so that you get an initial understanding of the relations and how data from different tables can be joined.
